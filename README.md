# Networking-Lab-Project
Designed and implemented a small enterprise-style network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The lab included VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing (router-on-a-stick), DHCP for automated IP addressing, NAT to simulate internet access, and ACLs to enforce basic security policies. End-to-end connectivity was tested and validated, and common network issues.
